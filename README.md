# StackLang

compile with 
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
```
read the source to see what the functions are, their all pretty self explanatory

# defining a function
```
define name as push 10 then push 20 then add
name = the name of the function
push 10, push 20, add the commands it calls
seperate the name and the commands with 'as'
seperate the commands with 'then'
```

# if statements
```
if push 10 then push 20
this function only executes if the top element in the working stack is 1 (as in true)
```
